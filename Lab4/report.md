####Objective
<<<<<<< HEAD
Create a C program that dispatches and schedules the execution of processes in multiple queues.

####Program Flow

######The Job Dispatch List:

The Host Dispatcher program will initially take in a list of processes and their requirements from a file. The requirements outline the amount of memory and other I/O devices that the process requires. Each process also outlines the arrival time, runtime and priority of each process. The program loads each process and it's outline into a queue, placing the processes one at a time into the data structure. Once the dispatch list has been fully loaded into the dispatch queue, the program starts its execution. Every second, the dispatch queue iterates through each of the processes in its queue. If the arrival time of a process in the dispatch queue is equal to the amount of seconds passed, the dispatch queue will put that process in its proper queue depending on the priority value of the process. The dispatcher program continues execution second by second until the dispatch queue is empty and all the processes have been run to completion.
